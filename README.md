## üöÄ API Usage

### Endpoint: `POST /yaml/validate`

Upload your OpenAPI specification file to this endpoint to receive a validation report.

**Request:**

The request must be sent as `multipart/form-data`.

- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/yaml/validate`
- **Form Field**:
  - `key`: `file`
  - `value`: Your `api-spec.yaml` or `api-spec.json` file.

**Example `cURL` Request:**

```bash
curl --location '[https://your-service-url.onrender.com/yaml/validate](https://your-service-url.onrender.com/yaml/validate)' \
--form 'file=@"/path/to/your/api-contract.yaml"'
```

### Response Format

The API provides a detailed JSON response, making it easy to integrate with other tools.

**‚úÖ Success Response (Status `200 OK` - Valid with Warnings)**

If the file is valid but contains warnings, you'll get a `200 OK` status.

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "status": "valid_with_warnings",
    "errorCount": 0,
    "warningCount": 1,
    "totalIssues": 1
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "warn",
      "rule": "info-contact",
      "message": "Info object must have 'contact' object.",
      "path": "info",
      "location": {
        "line": 2,
        "character": 6
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**‚ùå Unprocessable Entity Response (Status `422 Unprocessable Entity` - Invalid)**

If the file has validation errors, the API will return a `422` status code.

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "status": "invalid",
    "errorCount": 1,
    "warningCount": 1,
    "totalIssues": 2
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "warn",
      "rule": "info-contact",
      "message": "Info object must have 'contact' object.",
      "path": "info",
      "location": {
        "line": 2,
        "character": 6
      }
    },
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "rule": "oas3-valid-media-example",
      "message": "'value' property must exist.",
      "path": "paths./users.post.requestBody.content.application/json.examples.example-1",
      "location": {
        "line": 52,
        "character": 20
      }
    }

}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Validation Rules

The validation logic is controlled by the `.spectral.yaml` file in the root of the project. By default, it uses the recommended ruleset for OpenAPI 3.x (`spectral:oas`).

You can easily add your own rules or modify existing ones by editing this file. For more information, see the [Spectral documentation on rulesets](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/docs/reference/rulesets.md).

**Example `.spectral.yaml`:**

```yaml
# Inherit the recommended OpenAPI rules
extends: spectral:oas

# Add your own custom rules
rules:
  # This rule will trigger a warning if an operation is missing a summary
  operation-summary-defined:
    description: "All operations must have a summary."
    given: "$.paths.*.*"
    then:
      field: summary
      function: truthy
    severity: warn
```
