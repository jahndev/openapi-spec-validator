Your API will be live in minutes.‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Validation RulesThe validation logic is controlled by the .spectral.yaml file in the root of the project. By default, it uses the recommended ruleset for OpenAPI 3.x (spectral:oas).You can easily add your own rules or modify existing ones by editing this file. For more information, see the Spectral documentation on rulesets.Example .spectral.yaml:# Inherit the recommended OpenAPI rules
extends: spectral:oas

# Add your own custom rules
rules:
  # This rule will trigger a warning if an operation is missing a summary
  operation-summary-defined:
    description: "All operations must have a summary."
    given: "$.paths.*.*"
    then:
      field: summary
      function: truthy
